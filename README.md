### Team Project V1

#### Welcome to Gotham City

Immediately upon entering Gotham City (and running our program using the SimCityRun file to run it on Eclipse) you will hear
the Batman soundtrack, which will immediately immerse yourself into the darkness, chaos, and unpredictability that is Gotham City.

#####For V1
As you can see in our GUI we have 4 different types of buildings: Market (top right), Bank (top middle), Restaurant (top left and sides),
Homes (bottom row).
When you click on a building, the screen zooms in and gets replaced with the GUI and animation of that building. There is a small black box 
on the top left of each zoomed in building view that can be clicked to return to the city view.

#####For V2

we weren't able to find out the perfect "hour length" for our program to run realistically.  By that we mean, the program may
run in a loop (e.g. the person keeps going to the restaurant and to the home repeatedly because every four hours he gets hungry
and each hour could be 5 seconds but in 20 seconds he will need to go to the restaurant to eat again) due to short hour lengths.
We kept it short for faster testing (and also for faster grading) since watching a program simulate for 5-15 minutes (representativ
of a full day) can take a toll on productivity.
